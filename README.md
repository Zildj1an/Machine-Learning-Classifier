# Machine-Learning-Classifier
Chose the one that best fits your data set: low-dimensional, high-dimensional, or sparsed.

* For low-dimensional data sets (low-dimension.py) the following estimators are used:
  + Linear SVC
  + K-Neighbors (most likely will show the best results at the report for your data)
  + Support Vector Machine
  + Bagging (Ensemble method)
  + Decission Tree
  
  Additionaly, other three classifiers are tested:
  
  + Perceptron
  + SGD (good for data samples with more than 100k samples)
  + Multinomial-NB
